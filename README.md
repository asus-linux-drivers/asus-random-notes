- Then enable and start service

## When is TLP running
 
> Symptom: some USB devices do not work reliable when TLP activates USB autosuspend mode.
>
> All input devices (driver usbhid), libsane-supported scanners and (as of version 1.4) audio devices get excluded by default. Itâ€™s therefore unnecessary to put them on the USB_DENYLIST. To circumvent the default for certain devices enter the IDs into USB_ALLOWLIST.
 
*(https://linrunner.de/tlp/faq/usb.html#usb-devices)*
 
- Connect device and get ID **2717:ff40**
```
$ lsusb
$ tlp-stat -u # or
```

- Add obtained ID in line `USB_ALLOWLIST="2717:ff40"` to config `$ sudo gedit /etc/tlp.conf`
 
*(This parameter was renamed with version 1.4. Until 1.3 it was called USB_WHITELIST. 1.4 and newer also recognize the old name.)*
 
- Apply changes
 
```
# do a config reload and restart
$ sudo tlp start
```
